My arduino project related to Energy Management and Renewable Systems

# Energy source management system (Arduino)
Tech Stack : Arduino , C++ , Sensors and Relays
An automatic source selector that switches between solar , battery and grid based on availability and voltage levels
Includes control logic for real time, energy switching

The Energy Source Management System (ESMS) is designed to efficiently manage and control multiple energy sources for domestic or industrial applications. This project focuses on integrating renewable energy with conventional power sources to ensure uninterrupted power supply while optimizing energy usage.
